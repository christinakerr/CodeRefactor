# Code Refactor

[The Horiseon homepage](https://christinakerr.github.io/CodeRefactor/) is designed to give potential customers an idea of the services and benefits Horiseon offers. I received a rough draft of this page and was tasked with making it more accessible and making the code easier to read and understand.

Semantic HTML played a large part in the code's refactoring, and created a more obvious structure to the HTML file. The code was also in need of some notes, so I labeled each section of the page in both the HTML and CSS documents.
